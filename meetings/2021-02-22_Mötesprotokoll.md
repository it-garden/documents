## $ 6 Register as Employer
With last and this year ending up as they have, the increase in activity, events, workshops, leaders, municipal collaboration/funding, never happened. 

We had hoped, with the "allmänna arvsfonden" application, to get the "huvudman" as employer; not having to deal with the extra administration ourselves. This plan is still active, but delayed with everything else.

So, when time allows, Marcus will register us as an employer, get F-skatt, and deal with taxes.


## $ 7 ITG channel inside of KK Discord
Channel was created, but still need a sticky-post with info

Sticky Post added

    * The plan is to check with other people and see wether it worth doing summercamp this year or not
    * Check with companies to have the budget known before making a decision
