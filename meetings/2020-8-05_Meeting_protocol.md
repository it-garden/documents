## § 6 Summer camp salaries
**Vote format***
For/Against/Abstain

*About vote: The initial plan was to not pay salaries to Engino responsible leaders (Ali and Sepide), as they did this as part of their research; so it was more "give and get" already. It was also uncertain if our budget would make it possible to pay for more than ~5 leaders. In the end the budget became 35'000kr, to cover expenses and salaries.*

- Vote: Should we pay out salary to all leaders that participated in this years summer camp?
- Result: Vote is postponed to check if we have to pay taxes on salaries. 


## § 7 Other Business
- Marcus checks if the organisation needs to pay taxes on salaries or not
- Marcus checks with Ali if they were expected to get payed
- Ruslan and Marcus meets to fix other paperwork, and book meeting with bank
- For next meeting, we check if we want to get a "F skattebevis"

Meeting was adjourned.
